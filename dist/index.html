            <p>Hello! Welcome to H V I U, a work in progress from <a href="https://rtvgilder.com/">Robin VanGilder</a>. This is a first-person dungeon crawler game that runs entirely in 
                the browser, on the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React framework</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>You can move around the dungeon using the arrow buttons in the lower right. Note that this game only displays properly on wide portrait-oriented 
                screens at this point. I have not yet added responsive functionality.
            </p>
            <p>In the future, it will have many more features, including combat and the ability to save your game, as you battle through many floors of dungeon. 
                I plan on adding an account system, which you will sign up for through the buttons below.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, for now, those things aren't quite working yet, so you can move <a href="hviu.html">right on to the game.</a></p>
