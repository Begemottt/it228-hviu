            <p>Hello! Welcome to H V I U, a work in progress from <a href="https://rtvgilder.com/">Robin VanGilder</a>. This is a first-person dungeon crawler game that runs entirely in 
                the browser, on the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React framework</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>You can move around the dungeon using the arrow buttons in the lower right. Note that this game only displays properly on wide portrait-oriented 
                screens at this point. I have not yet added responsive functionality.
            </p>
            <p>It's in a pretty rough state right now, but it has many complete features. Combat, dungeon traversal, and dialogue are all in working order. 
                It doesn't yet have a win condition, so don't worry. I'm planning on including several floors of dungeon, as well as an account system so you can 
                save your game. Thus the buttons below.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, for now, those things aren't quite working yet, so you can move <a href="hviu.html">right on to the game.</a></p>
