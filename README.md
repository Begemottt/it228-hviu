# The Heartless Voids and Immensities of the Universe
My capstone project for web design! It's going to be a game made in React.

The game will be a first-person dungeon crawler, using CSS to style and manipulate a dungeon view, and generate visual effects. I am learning React for this project, so it will probably be a bit rough!
